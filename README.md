## Overview

Many websites have functionality that can get files as inputs. Some website accept only one file(e.g. icon image) and others accept multiple files.

In this project, I practiced react by creating file input field that accept multiple image files.

Following are features this webpage has.

1. [Upload image using HTML input tag](#scroll-to-top-button)
2. [Upload image using drag-and-drop](#quick-menu)
3. [Delete image](#navigation-bar)
